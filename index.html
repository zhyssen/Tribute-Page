    <p>Schitt’s Creek is a Canadian sitcom created by Dan Levy and his father, Eugene Levy. The show revolves around the lifestyle adjustments the Rose family has to endure after losing their multi-million dollar fortune. The once jet-set family is now forced to live out of two rooms in a motel located in the town of Schitt’s Creek. The town was purchased by Johnny Rose as a gag gift for his son, David. The show aired for six seasons and each lead actor won an Emmy for their acting category after the final season.</p>
